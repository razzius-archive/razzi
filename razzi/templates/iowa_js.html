<h1>May 18, 2013: Iowa JS</h1>
<p>After stumbling upon a member of the Heroku team who happens to be based in Iowa City, <a href="http://geemus.com">Wesley Beary</a>, I followed a few links and wound up on the Meetup page for Iowa JS. Their monthly meeting for May fortuitously overlapped with my time at home!</p>
<p>Apparently rule #8 there is that if it's your first time at Iowa JS, you have to give a lightening talk (I've heard no mention of other numbered rules), so I put together a few slides using <a href="http://slid.es">reveal.js</a>. As I'm a student, the natural topic was online learning.</p>

<p>The other talks were about node and load balancing, browserify.js, and TypeScript, which I found particularly interesting. TypeScript isn't as appealing as CoffeeScript (mostly because I'm a python fan) but I'm curious to see its adoption.</p>
